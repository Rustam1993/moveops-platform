# Decisions

## Phase 0
- Treat OpenAPI as the source of truth for backend + generated TS client (Phase 1+).
- Migration tooling is an MVP feature (sales-critical), not “later”.
- Use original UI wording; legacy labels are used only for mapping and import parity.
- Multi-tenant + RBAC + audit logging are non-negotiable foundations (Phase 1).
